# Nomas PWA Sprint Plan Review

## Overall Assessment: **Yes, with minor suggestions**

This is a well-structured and realistic sprint plan for building a PWA for Nomas. The progression from foundations → core features → polish → admin tools follows software development best practices.

## Strengths

### 1. **Solid Foundation First**
- Sprint 0 dedicates proper time to DevOps, testing infrastructure, and authentication

- CI/CD pipeline from day one ensures quality throughout development

### 2. **MVP-Focused Approach**
- Sprint 1 delivers immediate user value (view and book events)
- Core booking logic with capacity enforcement prevents overbooking issues
- Clear focus on essential features before nice-to-haves

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- PWA features are layered in gradually (manifest → service worker → offline)
- Performance optimization comes after functionality
- Accessibility is explicitly addressed

### 4. **Realistic Scope**
- 8-week timeline for 3-person team is achievable
- Stretch goals are clearly marked
- Each sprint has clear, measurable outcomes

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. **Add Error Handling & Edge Cases (Sprint 1)**
- What happens if booking fails mid-transaction?
- Handle race conditions for last available slot
- Add retry logic for network failures

### 2. **Consider User Feedback Loop (Sprint 2)**
- Add basic analytics to understand user behavior
- Simple feedback mechanism (even just a contact form)
- Error tracking (Sentry or similar)

### 3. **Security Considerations**
- Add rate limiting for bookings (prevent spam)

- Audit logging for admin actions

### 4. **Mobile-First Testing**
- Explicitly test on actual mobile devices, not just responsive view
- Test PWA installation flow on iOS and Android
- Verify offline functionality on various network conditions

### 5. **Data Migration Strategy**
- Plan for schema changes between sprints
- Document rollback procedures
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Supabase Dependency**: Have a backup plan if Supabase has issues
2. **Third-party Integrations**: Calendar integration might be trickier than expected
3. **Performance**: With many bookings, queries might slow down - plan for indexing

## Recommended Additions

- **Sprint 0**: Add basic monitoring/alerting setup
- **Sprint 1**: Include basic email notifications for bookings
- **Sprint 2**: Add booking confirmation emails with calendar attachments
- **Sprint 3**: Include basic reporting for admins (booking statistics)

## Conclusion

This sprint plan demonstrates excellent planning with clear deliverables, realistic timelines, and proper technical foundations. The progressive approach from MVP to full-featured app minimizes risk while delivering value early. With the minor additions suggested above, this plan sets the project up for success.

The 75 story points across 8 weeks for a 3-person team (roughly 3 points per person per week) is conservative and allows buffer for unexpected challenges.
